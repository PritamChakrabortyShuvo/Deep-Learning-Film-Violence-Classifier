# Code File Sequence Overview
This repository contains all the core scripts carefully structured to walk you through the entire process of **violent** & **non-violent** scene classification from start to finish. Each file plays a critical role in preparing, training & evaluating the model enabling efficient and accurate classification. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

## 01-Libraries.py
Initializes all the essential libraries required for the project.
